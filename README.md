## Features
- Browser-based fingerprint authentication
- WebAuthn API integration
- Simple user interface
- Real-time authentication feedback

## Technical Stack
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- WebAuthn API
- React (First-time implementation)

## Project Context
This prototype was developed as a 24-hour challenge to explore modern web authentication methods. While the codebase contains areas for improvement and optimization, it successfully demonstrates core biometric authentication concepts.

## Development Process
I leveraged several tools to assist in rapid development:
- GitHub Copilot for code suggestions
- AI assistance for understanding WebAuthn concepts
- Open source examples for React implementation
- Currently in the process of understanding each component deeply

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Basic fingerprint authentication
- ‚úÖ Working prototype
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Known limitations due to time constraints
- üîÑ Potential for future refinements
- üìö Ongoing learning and code understanding

## Learning Outcomes
- First-time implementation of React
- Understanding of WebAuthn API
- Rapid prototyping experience
- Web security fundamentals
- AI-assisted development experience

## Future Improvements
- Enhanced error handling
- Improved UI/UX
- Code optimization
- Additional security features
- Better documentation of code functionality
- Create a functioning backend (This is just a static front end)

## Acknowledgments
Built as a learning exercise and challenge assessment. While the code may not be production-ready, it serves as a valuable proof-of-concept and learning milestone in my development journey.

### Note on AI Assistance
This project was developed with the help of AI tools and GitHub Copilot. I'm actively working on understanding each component and implementation detail to grow as a developer.
